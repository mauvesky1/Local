        <p>Our parliament is not representative.
 </p> <p>
 
If you were a Member of Parliament for a political party and you wanted to vote the way your party had promised, or in the interests of your constituency, the whip system would stand in your way. The whips control committee places, offices, travel opportunities and who can be a member of the party. If you’re expelled from the party you’re not going to keep your seat, so they effectively have the power to decide who gets into Parliament. The party leadership control who becomes a minister and who gets on the payroll vote, which is those 150 or so MPs who, by virtue of their position in government, have agreed to always vote for the government.  
 
        They’ve guaranteed that they are yes men. </p><p>
 
Labour MP Dianne Abott said that: “Any government MP who goes on a committee with the genuine intention of scrutinising legislation knows they risk their career. As a further refinement. Government whips do their best to ensure that anyone who knows or cares about the legislation does not get on the committee in the first place.” 
 
And Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said: “I received a note to inform me that my only duties were to turn up on time, say nothing and vote with the government”  </p> <p>
 
If Parliament has expertise in an area, the whips will rush about to make sure they remain ignored and kept out of the picture.  MPs represent their parties, not their constituents.
 
MPs need to have the power to act on their principles, and that is only going to happen when they have the whips removed from them and there is no party leadership to bow down to. </p> <p>
 
This is a structural communication problem in politics that affects all parties where the electorates’ wishes aren’t acted on, and the electorate can’t get their opinions across at election time. 
   
        </p> <p> To straighten out politics we need to abolish the power of the whips and the party leadership and give it back to the people. MPs should be elected by local constituency groups, made up of representatives from parish councils. 

Political Parties are never going to approve of their own demise.
The reason that these boards should be elected by parish councils is that it does not require Parliament’s permission to set them up.
  </p>
        <p>
          MPs should be elected by a group of people, chosen by Parish Councils. Why Parish councils? Because there
          already exists a mechanism to set up parish councils accross the country and it does not rely on current MPs
          voting against the existing political structure.</p>
